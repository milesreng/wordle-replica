# wordle-replica

this is a replica of the popular game wordle for me and friends in case NYT does what NYT does and paywalls wordle

the characters that point to each letter are as follows:

  ^ : the letter is in the correct place
  
  | : the letter is in the word, but not in that place
  
  _ : the letter is not in the word
